## About Me
Hello, I am Jonathan Nguyen, a student at UCSD. My major is **Mathematics - Computer Science** and
I am currently a third year.

Here are some of my classes this quarter:
* CSE 190 (Working with Large Code Bases)
* MATH 140C (Real Analysis III)
* CSE 110 (Software Engineering)
* CAT 125 (Public Rhetoric and Prac Comm)

### Valorant

In my free time, I enjoy playing some games like *VALORANT*, in which I hold a respectable rank of Immortal.<br>

Here's my [tracker.gg](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/recal%2523ieme/overview), a common website to view *VALORANT* stats.

Here's one of the agents I play in *VALORANT*:

### Minesweeper
Sometimes I also like to play Minesweeper, at [minesweeper.online](https://minesweeper.online)
<br>
Here are some of my fastest times on Minesweeper, organized by board difficulty.

| Difficulty | Time (seconds) |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Beginner      | 2.194     |
| Intermediate     | 20.977     |
| Expert      | 64.383     |

Here's the hardest difficulty board I've ever completed, with a difficulty of about 5000 (beginner difficulty is about 1 so this is maybe 5000x harder)

### Top Animes
I would also just like to state some of my favorite animes of all time, <br>
for no particular reason other than to make an ordered list.
1. Frieren, Beyond Journey's End
2. Attack On Titan
3. Solo Leveling
4. Sword Art Online
5. Blue Lock

### Example of Python Code

I sometimes like to code in Python, so here's a code snippet:

```
import math

def tetration(num, arrows):
    sol = num
    for i in range(arrows):
        sol = Math.pow(num, sol)
    return sol

tetration(3,2)
#i did not test this
```

Note carefully that I used `import math`, if not used then the function will not be able to be called. Sometimes I also like to `import itertools` or `import matplotlib`.


### Quote by Me
I made sure to say this aloud so that I can use it here

> I love markdown! This is the best thing I've ever used, it is so versatile and easy to use.
